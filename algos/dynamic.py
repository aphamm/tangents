Dynamic programming breaks a complicated problem into simpler subproblems in a recursive manner.

Optimal Substructure: solution to optimization problem can be solved by the combination of optimal solutions to its subproblems

Overlapping Subproblems: subproblem is repeated several times

Divide & Conquer: problem solved by combining optimal solutions to non-overlapping subproblems
