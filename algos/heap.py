Priority Queue: an abstract data type implented with a heap

    2. Delete_Min/Max (values == data we wish to store)

Max/Min Heap:

    1. an almost complete tree (traverse level order)
    2. (Min Heap) children's key is greater than parent

Useful: height guaranteed to be O(logN) & insert/delete O(logN)
Implemented: usually as an array. for node i, its children are (2i+1, 2i+2) and its parent is at floor((i-1)/2)

Problem: Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
Input: points
Output: Return the k closest points.
Other: The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).

Framework: Heap
Giveaways: We need to order points based on a sorting criteria (key)
Big Picture: We will insert points into a heap based on their Euclidean distance from the origin.

Process: 

    1. Push points into a minHeap using distance as a key.
    2. Return the first k elements.

Problem: Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, return the kth smallest element in the matrix.
Input: matrix, k
Output: Return kth smallest
Other: You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n2).

Framework: Heap
Giveaways: Just think of Merge Sort. We've already sorted M arrays and now need to merge them. We keep a heap of the smallest current element in each M arrays and thus will know exactly what to insert next sorted list. In this case, we wish to simply iterate to the next element to find the k+1 smallest element.
Big Picture: Create an initial heap with all elements in the first column. This essentially acts as a storing pointers for each row to determine the next lowest value in that row. We can then pop the value, i, j from the heap and then push the next element in the row (stop if we reach the end of the row).

Process:

    1. Heapify (value, i, j) the first element in each row (first column)

Problem: Given a string s, rearrange the characters of s so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.
Input: s
Output: Return any possible rearrangement of s or return "" if not possible.

Framework: Heap
Giveaways: We need to keep an updated tally of the two most frequent characters as we continually use them to create our string
Big Picture: Once we have the character frequencies, we will want to use the characters in pairs. This is 1) so we use up the high frequency characters first and 2) a character will not touch itself given the two characters in the pair are distinct. We will need a heap to keep a updating tally of the two most frequent characters

Process: 

    1. Create a maxHeap of (frequency, character)
    2. Pop from the heap in pairs
        a) Add the characters to the string
        b) If the frequency is >2, push back onto stack
    3. Check for any single elements left in the heap
        a) Ensure the frequency is NOT >2

Other: An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
Other: The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

Giveaways: We want to keep two piles of numbers. We will designate a small and big pile as the first/second pile. At all times, we want to know the biggest element of the first pile and the smallest element of the second pile. We will use a maxHeap and minHeap for the first/second pile respectively.
Big Picture: At all times, we will have at least N elements in the first pile and N OR N+1 in the second pile. If there are N elements in the second, we will just return the the average of the two piles (heap[0]). If there are N+1 elements in the second, we will return the second pile (heap[0]).

    1. Init two heaps.
